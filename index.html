                            This site is currenty underconstruction, but it is
                            functional. It uses jquery, html, css,
                            javascript and firebase. The game at a base level allows you to play
                            against a friend through firebase as well as play against a default
                            computer selector. Currently you can
                            create a new User login with a unique avatar, login, see avialable
                            users, request games, accept game requests and play eachother.
                        </p>
                        <p> What still needs to be done is create a logout function, I am looking into having a system
                            that logs you out when you close the browser.

                            I really enjoy web design, and this site was a good opportunity to learn more about css
                            animations. I also created all images both buttons and avatars from scratch.
                            I hope you take the time to check it out.

                            This was my final project in my coding course. The initial intent was to
                            build a forum, like reddit, for
                            posting content that was visually exciting. The user interface we
                            settled on ended up being a sort of
                            reddit, Pinterest hybrid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Something important to me is effectively being able to utilize these
                            massive bright screens that crowd
                            our desks these days. They are built for entertainment. Let’s face it,
                            Reddit is ugly. So are most
                            websites these days. Our screens are bigger, but to avoid things looking
                            like children’s book everything
                            stays small, and we just cram in more. They become nightmares to use
                            because you are overwhelmed by
                            options. Focus is lost. These ideas gave rise to this design. It became
                            a browsing/informative hybrid
                            that I quite like. We force the user to think about the image they will
                            use to get people’s attention,
                            and this in turn create a much more instinctive interface. Curiosity is
                            by its very nature hesitant, a
                            website that relies on curiosity fails to truly captivate instinct. The
                            UI/Design work here was my baby
                            in both its conception and coding. I hope you enjoy it and find it
                            entertaining to use. Also look at the
                            very informative readme on git hub to see where we intend to take the
                            site in the future.

                            This site began as joint class project, however it has changed
                            so
                            much recently that it is basically almost all my work. The
                            initial
                            idea
                            was to create a sports dashboard where NBA fans could keep up
                            with
                            their favorite teams and players. This was our first full stack
                            project, and because of the nervousness of the others in my
                            group, I
                            was tasked with the entire backend as well as most all the
                            communication back and forth. They just did front end design
                            stuff,
                            and one of the API’s that is still being utilized, although it
                            has
                            been repurposed. After our presentation I began working on the
                            site
                            myself. I have since completely redesigned an extremely
                            responsive
                            visually dynamic User interface as well as built my own
                            information
                            gathering tools using cheerio and several other API’s. This project
                            has
                            by and far taken the most of my time and is the largest. I'd
                            estimates
                            my personal time spent in hours here in the 2 to 3 hundred range.

                            Once you have signed into the site If you change the last
                            integer in
                            the URL you can see different user profiles. This obviously is
                            not
                            ideal, but it was a quick solution implemented when building my
                            first full stack app, that I kept for its convenience in showing
                            off
                            the app’s versatility.
